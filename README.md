# Overview

This app provides an interactive learning platform for medical students, focusing on dermatological diagnosis. It presents users with real-world images of skin conditions and challenges them to make a diagnosis. After each attempt, the app delivers personalized feedback, explaining the reasoning behind the correct answer, whether the diagnosis was accurate or not. By emphasizing pattern recognition and critical thinking, in concert with a comprehensive dataset of over 400,000 images, the app helps students refine their diagnostic skills in a hands-on manner. With its ability to adapt to individual performance, the app ensures a tailored learning experience, making it an effective tool for bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical application.

# Inspiration

The inspiration for this app arose from two key insights about medical education. 
1. Medicine is inherently interdisciplinary. For example, in fields like dermatology, pattern recognition plays a vital role in diagnosis. Previous studies have shown that incorporating techniques from other fields, such as art analysis, can enhance these skills, highlighting the benefits of cross-disciplinary approaches. Additionally, with the rapid advancement of AI, which has its roots in pattern recognition, there is a tremendous opportunity to revolutionize medical training. 
2. Second, traditional methods like textbooks and static images often lack the interactivity and personalized feedback needed to develop diagnostic skills effectively. Current education emphasizes the knowledge of various diagnostic features, but not the ability to recognize such features. This app was designed to address these gaps, creating a dynamic, tech-driven solution to better prepare medical students for the complexities of real-world practice.
